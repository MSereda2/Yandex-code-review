/* 
### ACTIONS:

Mistake:‚ùó
We don't make dispatch here. It's the wrong place.

Why:
We always should make dispatch in UI if we want to change the state.
It's a principle called separation of concerns. In this file, we shouldn't make the dispatch.

Solution:
Create an action creator for each case and dispatch them from UI.

General notes:
You're using const for the type of actions that's an amazing thing.üî•
You still can do better and add the name of reducer to the const.
For example: from const LOG_IN = 'LOG_IN' to const SESSION_LOG_IN = 'SESSION_LOG_IN';
It's better because you make your actions unique.
