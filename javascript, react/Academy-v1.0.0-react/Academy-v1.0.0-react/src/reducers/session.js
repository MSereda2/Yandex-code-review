### REDUCER:

Mistake:‚ùó
You've made a shallow copy but should deep.

Why:
You've made a shallow copy and therefore you're only copied top-level object
but at line 13 you have an object which is still referenced.
If the source value is a reference to an object, it only copies that reference value to the target object.

Solution:
Make a deep copy of the object user at line 13üòä

General notes:
