/*
### IMPLEMENTED FUNCTIONALITY:

Mistake:
Form doesn't work.‚ùó

Why:
Code has some troubles in Form class and in Person class.

Solution:
I don't tell you the answer try to solve by yourself. But I can give a hint.
Method isSunny of class Person return undefined.
Figured out why it returns undefined and what consequences it has.
And second, there is something wrong with how you read data from a form input,
figure out what your inputs form return and what consequences it has.

------------------------------

Mistake:
Search with a filter doesn't work.‚ùó

Why:
Code has Trouble in Search class.

Solution: as with the first mistake I don't tell you the answer,
try to solve by yourself. But a hint, of course, I give you.
In the class search method, setEventLister doesn't trigger
you need to figure out why it doesn't trigger.

*/


/* 
### CODE ORGANIZATION:	

Warning:‚ö†Ô∏è
Files doesn't have a clear structure.

Why:
All files are located in the root directory,
and as it gets more files it will be difficult to manage all of this.

Solution:
A good decision will be here to use MVC architecture.
You just need to separate your model and view and connect them with a controller.
Read about it here https://www.guru99.com/mvc-tutorial.html.

/*
### VARIABLE NAMING CONVENTIONS.

Success:‚úÖ
Naming conventions of the code quite good.
I just marked some variables in the code, that can be improved.

General notes:
Read this amazing article about the variable convention. 
https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_conventions.asp.
it's a really important topic in programming general.
